sample: numbers that represent the values of some audio signal at a particular point in time

---
WAV files:
- a common file format for representing audio
- store audio as a sequence of "sample"
- begin with a 44-byte "header" contains information about 
	+ the size of the file
	+ number of sample per second
	+ size of each sample
- after the header, the WAV file contains a squence of sample
	+ each a single 2-byte (16-bit) integer representing the audio signal at 
	a particular point in time.
- Scaling each sampe value by a given facter => changing the volumne of the audio
---
Types
- stdint.h : are declarations of a number of other types
	uint8_t: is a type that stores an 8-bit unsigned integer (WAV file's header)
	int16_t: is a type that stores a 16-bit signed integer (Audio in WAV files)
---
Implementation Details
- Changees the volume of a sound file
- fread function:
	- ptr: a pointer to the location in memory to store data (when reading from a file)
	or from wich to write data (when writing data to a file
	- size: the number of bytes in an item of data
	- nmemb: the number of data (each of size bytes) to read or write
	- stream: the file pointer to be read or written to
- ...
- 03 command-line arguments: input oupt factor
	input: name of the orginal audio file
	output: name of the new audio file
- step 1: read the header from the input file => write the header to the output file (44 bytes long)
	- long 44 bytes 
	- header 
- step 2: read the rest of the data, one 16-bit (2-byte) sample at a time
-------------------------------
WAV files:
- One 44-byte header
- Many 2-byte samples
	- to change the volume of a sample, multiply the sample by a number
