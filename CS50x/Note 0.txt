- Component of Super Mario
- A web application called CS50 Finance
- Very own final project

What is computer science?
1. taking some input (details about our problem) 
2. generate some output (the solution to our problem)
3. The “black box” in the middle is computer science, or the code we’ll learn to write.

- problem solving 
	+ represent inputs and outputs
	+ store information
	+ work with information

Representing
- numbers: binary => transitors
- text: numbers map to letter/characters (ASCII, Unicode)
- Image, video, sounds: 
	+ colors (RGB: the amount of red, green, and blue) ~ three bytes;
	+ pixels = three bytes
	+ resolution = number of pixels
	+ videos = more images
	+ sounds = numbers ~ (notes, durations, sound frequencies)

Algorithms
- black box
- correct
- bug
- the efficiency of each of thoses algorithms
	- linear
	- logarithmic (log2n, or log base 2 of n, we're deviding the problem by two with each step)
- care: correct + design + other factors (efficiency)
---
Pseudocode
- a representation of our algorithm in human language
	+ Functions
	+ Conditions
	+ Boolean expressions	
	+ Loops
---
Scratch
- a graphical programming language
	+ abstraction
	+ implementation details

Project
Baby steps: 
1. write a bit of code
2. test
3. write a bit more
4. test
